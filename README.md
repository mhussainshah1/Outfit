### Final Project - Outfit of the Day Suggestion

Create an application that would suggest an outfit to the users each day. Allow the users to enter all of the item in
their wardrobe.(https://outfitspringboot.herokuapp.com)

A wardrobe at the very least should include:

- Tops (shirts, tank tops, sweaters)
- Bottoms (pants, skirts, shorts)
- Jackets (light jackets, rain jackets or heavy coats)
- Shoes (rain boots, sneakers, dress shoes, sandals)

The users should also be able to input optional accessories (hats, scarves, gloves, jewelry, scarves, handbags) or
create their own categories.

Each wardrobe item should have:

- A category
- Color
- Long/short sleeves or Long pants/shorts
- Fabric material
- An image of that item

The application should obtain the temperature for that day based on the users's entered location and suggest an outfit
that suits the weather and the occasion the outfit will be worn for.

The application should allow new users to sign up for an account and track their wardrobe item. Users can update
information regarding each of their item or remove item from their wardrobe.

Users should also be able to create packing lists for upcoming trips using item from their wardrobe.
